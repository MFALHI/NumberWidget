A widget which displays a random number that is updated every 30 minutes and updates once user clicks on it<br>

I have created a widget which displays a random number. This random number is updated every 30 minutes.<br> 

I have also registered an `OnClickListener` so that the widgets update once the user clicks on it.<br>
